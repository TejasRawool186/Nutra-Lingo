📘 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (SRS)
🏷 Product Name:

NutraLingo

🎯 Tagline:

Your food label, decoded in your language.

1️⃣ PROJECT OVERVIEW
1.1 Purpose

NutraLingo is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that enables users to scan packaged food labels written in any language, extract ingredient and nutrition information, analyze health impact based on user medical profile, and localize the explanation into the user’s native language using Lingo.dev.

Localization intelligence is the core system layer.

1.2 Objectives

NutraLingo aims to:

Eliminate health risks caused by foreign-language food packaging.

Provide AI-based structured ingredient extraction.

Deliver condition-based health risk analysis.

Use Lingo.dev for intent-preserving multilingual medical localization.

Provide voice-based explanation for accessibility.

2️⃣ SYSTEM SCOPE

NutraLingo will:

Capture food label images (camera or upload)

Extract structured data from packaging

Analyze health impact

Personalize based on user profile

Localize explanation using Lingo.dev

Provide voice explanation

Display health score with interactive UI

NutraLingo will NOT:

Use barcode database

Provide medical diagnosis

Replace doctor consultation

Provide regulatory compliance certification

3️⃣ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
3.1 High-Level Flow

User → Capture Image → OCR Extraction → Structured Parsing → Health Reasoning → Lingo.dev Localization → Voice Output → UI Display

3.2 Core Technology Stack

Frontend:

Next.js (PWA enabled)

TailwindCSS

Camera API

Backend:

Node.js + Express

AI:

OpenAI Vision (OCR)

GPT-4o (structured extraction + health reasoning)

Lingo.dev API (localization intelligence)

OpenAI TTS (voice output)

Deployment:

Vercel (Frontend)

Railway/Render (Backend)

4️⃣ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Image Capture Module

FR-1: System shall allow user to capture image via live camera.

FR-2: System shall allow image upload from gallery.

FR-3: System shall compress image before backend processing.

FR-4: System shall display extraction confidence score.

4.2 OCR & Structured Extraction Module

FR-5: System shall extract:

Ingredient list

Nutrition table

Serving size

Additives (E-codes)

FR-6: System shall structure output in strict JSON format.

FR-7: System shall validate numeric values (sodium, calories, sugar).

FR-8: System shall request rescan if confidence < threshold.

4.3 Health Reasoning Module

FR-9: System shall compute Health Score (0–10).

FR-10: System shall detect:

High sodium

Hidden sugar variants

Trans fats

Artificial additives

FR-11: System shall adapt analysis based on user profile:

Hypertension

Diabetes

General preventive

FR-12: System shall highlight risky ingredients visually.

4.4 Localization Module (CORE)

FR-13: System shall use Lingo.dev to:

Translate medical explanations

Preserve scientific terminology

Adapt tone based on language

Adjust literacy level

Provide culturally contextual dietary advice

FR-14: System shall support minimum 3 languages initially.

FR-15: System shall allow dynamic language switching.

4.5 Voice Explanation Module

FR-16: System shall generate voice explanation in selected language.

FR-17: System shall allow replay of explanation.

4.6 UI Interaction Module

FR-18: System shall display animated health score dial.

FR-19: System shall show ingredient highlight interaction.

FR-20: System shall use emerald-green success and red-risk color signals.

FR-21: System shall support mobile-first responsive layout.

5️⃣ NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
5.1 Performance

Image processing < 8 seconds

Health reasoning < 5 seconds

Localization < 3 seconds

5.2 Reliability

System shall handle invalid image gracefully.

System shall provide fallback message if OCR fails.

5.3 Usability

UI must be usable with one hand.

Buttons must be large (mobile-first).

Text must be readable in multiple scripts.

5.4 Security

Images shall not be permanently stored.

API keys stored in environment variables.

HTTPS enforced.

6️⃣ CORE DIFFERENTIATION

NutraLingo is NOT a translation tool.

It is:

A localization-aware health intelligence system.

Without Lingo.dev:

Medical tone would break.

Ingredient context would be lost.

Cultural adaptation would fail.

Literacy adaptation would fail.

Lingo.dev is the core layer connecting health reasoning to human understanding.

7️⃣ PRIMARY USER PERSONAS

International traveler in foreign country.

Hypertension patient checking sodium levels.

Diabetic user checking sugar forms.

Rural user needing explanation in native language.

8️⃣ SUCCESS CRITERIA

NutraLingo is successful if:

It accurately extracts nutrition from foreign packaging.

It produces structured, explainable health output.

It localizes explanation in user’s native language.

It demonstrates clear dependency on Lingo.dev.

It delivers smooth demo under 2 minutes.

9️⃣ FUTURE ROADMAP (Post Hackathon)

Offline caching

Allergen detection module

QR emergency card

Personalized diet tracking

🔟 FINAL POSITIONING STATEMENT

NutraLingo is:

A multilingual preventive health intelligence platform that bridges the gap between complex food labels and real human understanding using AI and localization intelligence powered by Lingo.dev.
